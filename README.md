Insert3D is the **easiest** ðŸ¥³and **fastest** ðŸš€way to embed a 3D model in your iOS app. It combines SceneKit and Model I/O into a simple library for creative iOS developers who want to provide a unique experience for their users.

# Installation

Use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Add the dependency to your `Podfile` and then run `pod install`:

```ruby
pod 'Insert3D'
```

# Quickstart

1. Import library
```swift
import Insert3D
```
2. Download and add example OBJ model ([example-model.zip](https://public-demo-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/example-model.zip))

3. Copy & Paste into viewDidLoad

```swift
var viewer = Insert3DViewer() 
	viewer.width = 380 
	viewer.height = 380

var model = Insert3DModel()
	model.mesh = "model/Nachos.obj"
	model.material = "model/NachosMaterial.jpg"

view.Insert3D(viewerSetup: viewer, modelSetup: model)
```
# Usage

Create instances of `Insert3DViewer()` and `Insert3DModel()` and specify parameters, then pass the instances into the main `view.Insert3D()` function to complete setup and display the viewer.

`Command + R` to Run

## Viewer

Instances of `Insert3DViewer()` set the dimensions and position of the `SCNView` subview where the model is a central node.

```swift
// Values can be progromatically set and adjusted at any time 
var viewer = Insert3DViewer() 
viewer.width = 380 // Width 
viewer.height = 380 // Height 
viewer.x = 20 // X position of the top left corner
viewer.y = 200 // Y position of the top left corner

viewer.background = UIColor.white // Specify background of viewer. White by default 

// Show the model! 
view.Insert3D(viewerSetup: viewer, modelSetup: model) // modelSetup is also required
```

**Dimensions**

Dimensions using the relative position on screen can be expressed by converting them into `Int` ([described here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3678255/centering-a-cgrect-in-a-view/3678285#3678285)).

Included are default values width = 200, height = 200, x = 0, and y = 0.

**Background**

Background support's `Any`, providing much flexibility for usage:

-   A color ([NSColor](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor>)/[UIColor](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor>) or [CGColor](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgcolor>)), specifying a uniform color for the materialâ€™s surface
-   A number ([NSNumber](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnumber>)), specifying a uniform scalar value for the material's surface (useful for physically based properties such as [metalness](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnmaterial/1640554-metalness>))
-   An image ([NSImage](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage>)/[UIImage](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage>) or [CGImage](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgimage>)), specifying a texture to be mapped across the materialâ€™s surface
-   An [NSString](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring>) or [NSURL](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurl>) object specifying the location of an image file
-   A video player ([AVPlayer](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer>)) or live video capture preview ([AVCaptureDevice](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice>), in iOS only)
-   A Core Animation layer ([CALayer](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer>))
-   A texture ([SKTexture](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sktexture>), [MDLTexture](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdltexture>), [MTLTexture](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltexture>), or [GLKTextureInfo](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/glkit/glktextureinfo>))
-   A SpriteKit scene ([SKScene](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skscene>))
-   A specially formatted image or array of six images, specifying the faces of a cube map


## Model

Instances of `Insert3DModel()` let `Insert3D()` know which model you'd like to use, along with how you'd like it configured within the viewer.

```swift
// Values can be progromatically set and adjusted at any time.
var model = Insert3DModel()
model.mesh = "my3DFilePath" // Currently supports OBJ
model.texture = "myTexturePath" // Supports image files already mapped to the model

model.autoRotate = true // Set true by default. Rotates on the horizontal axis
model.rotationSpeed = 9 // Model makes one full rotation every 9 seconds

model.fixed = false // Set false by deafault. Should the model be movable/rotatable by a user?

// Show the model!
view.Insert3D(viewerSetup: viewer, modelSetup: model) // viewerSetup is also required

```
NOTE: There are infinite possible customization one could apply to a model, and included here are the basic ones. Consider expanding this repository's functionality via a contribution.
